text adventure basic requirements:
    - move around the room - room should be split into sections each section contains different parts of the room
    - objects in the room - a class for intractable objects
    - ability to interact with objects - objects have interaction methods
    - can pick up objects - an inventory class or maybe an array in a player class
    - can use objects on other objects - an important interaction method, only called on objects in inventory

basic plan:
    - have a room, which contains a few objects, the player can interact with them
    - one of the objects is a key another is a door, the door will have a method to open it,
        when you interact with it they tend to call a method that moves you to a new location
        for now it will call the victory method
    - player can look around, see some stuff then pick up the key and leave, expand from there
